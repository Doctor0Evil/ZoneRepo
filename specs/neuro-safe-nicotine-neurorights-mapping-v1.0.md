## 1. Mental Privacy

Requirement:
- No unauthorized access, recording, or analysis of brain data for governance or social control.[file:28]

Architecture alignment:
- Neural craving biomarkers are used only for intra-personal relief control, within HostBudget and BioCompatibilityEnvelope.[file:23]
- EcoAdmissible and KarmaAdmissible predicates are functions only of environmental flows and CEIM ledgers, never neural data.[file:28]
- No neural metrics enter licensing, credit, or law-enforcement decisions.

Gap to watch:
- Any attempt by vendors or insurers to reuse craving logs for profiling must be flagged as protocol violation.

## 2. Cognitive Liberty

Requirement:
- Freedom to think, decide, and feel without coercive manipulation.[file:28]

Architecture alignment:
- No controller may use y_crave to trigger punitive actions or limit basic rights.
- Neuromodulation is elective and revocable; default state is no stimulation.[file:23]
- Lyapunov control law is designed for “relief without overload,” not behavior enforcement.[file:23]

Gap to watch:
- Ensure no coupling between K_person (ecological Karma) and access to neuromodulation cures; ecological debt may never justify forced neuromodulation.[file:28]

## 3. Mental Integrity and Psychological Continuity

Requirement:
- Protection from interventions that damage cognitive capacities or personal identity.[file:28]

Architecture alignment:
- BCI* 0.3 and HostBudget ≤ 0.3 are hard ceilings proven to bound neural and systemic stress in regimes where agency and consent are preserved.[file:23]
- Closed-loop neuromodulation must shut down when approaching these ceilings; any attempt to cross is a logged Errority breach.[file:23][file:24]
- No n1/n2 dreamplex or dream-context modules are permitted anywhere in the stack, per neurorights policies in other specs.[file:23]

Gap to watch:
- Longitudinal drift: cumulative small changes must be monitored for subtle identity erosion; Errority must track slow trends, not only acute events.

## 4. Environmental Accountability and Lawfulness

Requirement:
- External permissions may be conditioned on environmental impact, but not inner states.[file:28]

Architecture alignment:
- EcoAdmissible and KarmaAdmissible predicates operate on CEIM mass-balance of emissions, waste, and resource use only.[file:28]
- Nicotine cure deployments must be ecologically net-positive relative to cigarette baselines.[file:28]
- Tobacco industry transitions are governed by environmental corridors, not neuro-metrics.

Gap to watch:
- Avoid any policy that makes neuromodulation mandatory for “high Karma debt” individuals.

## 5. Equity and Non-Discrimination

Requirement:
- Avoid disproportionate burdens on already marginalized groups; provide restorative pathways.[file:28]

Architecture alignment:
- All thresholds and weights (A_eco, b_eco, K_max) must be documented and contestable.[file:28]
- Evaluation plans must track distribution of access and side-effects by demographic group.
- Restorative options: participation in ecological repair or community health projects can improve K_person without any neural intervention.[file:28]

Gap to watch:
- Clinic siting and device availability must not mirror historical inequities (e.g., fewer safe clinics in low-income areas).

## 6. Errority as Protective Mechanism

- Any harm or unfair pattern that appears inside nominal safety corridors triggers Errority events that can only:
  - Tighten polytopes (P_bio, P_eco).
  - Adjust normative weights openly.
- Errority is explicitly forbidden from:
  - Weakening neurorights.
  - Introducing neural surveillance.
  - Justifying coercive neuromodulation.[file:24][file:28]
