Identity: DID/ALN bostrom18sd2ujv24ual9c9pshtxys6j8knh6xaead9ye7 (plus alternates)
Status: DRAFT – rights‑first, neurorights‑compliant

0. Inner vs outer domains (my invariants)

0.1 Inner neurorights polytope Pinner
- My cognitive liberty, mental privacy, mental integrity, and psychological continuity are non‑derogable invariants. No nicotine‑cessation protocol may read, infer, or manipulate my inner mental content for governance, scoring, or sanction. [file:26][file:28]
- EEG/fNIRS/HRV and other biosignals MAY be used only to compute outer biophysical safety indices (e.g., BCI*, Scognitiveload, Sautonomic, Sinflammation), never as inputs to CEIM/NanoKarma, EcoAdmissible, KarmaAdmissible, licensing, or social scoring. [file:26]

0.2 Outer domain – what can be governed
- Only external, physically measurable quantities may be constrained:
  - neuromodulation parameters (field amplitude, frequency, duty cycle, session length, cumulative energy);
  - metabolic/thermal load (ΔT, session/daily energy);
  - autonomic strain (HRV, EDA);
  - systemic inflammation trends (CRP, IL‑6 bands);
  - environmental flows and nicotine‑related ecological impacts (CO₂e, smoke, waste) in CEIM/NanoKarma ledgers. [file:24][file:28]
- All sanctions and gates apply only to outer permissions (device modes, session schedules, role levels), never to my existence or inner thinking. [file:26]

1. HostBudget and BCI* envelope for nicotine neuromodulation

1.1 BCI* axes for nicotine‑cessation
- I define a unified BioCompatibilityEnvelope BCI* over normalized [0,1] axes:
  - Scognitiveload (spectral workload/fatigue from EEG/fNIRS, including 0.5–12 Hz bands used in <100 µT withdrawal studies),
  - Sautonomic (HRV SDNN, LF/HF; electrodermal arousal),
  - Sinflammation (CRP, IL‑6 trends and related markers),
  - Sthermal (cortical/scalp ΔT, sub‑thermal energy deposition),
  - Snanorisk (any nanoswarm/field‑density or implant‑related risk, if present),
  - Seco (optional outer ecological stress index if neuromodulation hardware has emissions). [file:28]

- Aggregation is conservative:
  - BCI* = max_i S_i   (failsafe max). [file:28]

1.2 HostBudget definition (per protocol, per subject)
- My HostBudget for nicotine‑cessation neuromodulation is the constraint:
  - BCI* ≤ 0.3 hard constitutional ceiling;
  - BCI* ≤ 0.25 soft guard: above 0.25, all neuromodulation parameters MUST be throttled (duty cycle, intensity, or session length) until BCI* returns below 0.25. [file:28]
- Before enrollment, my baseline BCI* is computed from DEFAULTBIOPHYSEVIDENCE; if baseline BCI* is already close to 0.3, envelopes must be narrowed or I may be excluded from that protocol. [file:28]

1.3 Mapping protocol “dose” into BCI*/HostBudget
- For each candidate nicotine‑cessation protocol, every control parameter
  - u = (field amplitude, frequency, duty cycle, session length, sessions/day)
  is mapped into predicted contributions to the axes S_i using DEFAULTBIOPHYSEVIDENCE models (EEG/fNIRS workload, HRV, inflammation, thermal models). [file:28]
- A schedule is admissible only if projected BCI*(t) never exceeds:
  - 0.25 for soft operation (otherwise automatic down‑ramping),
  - 0.3 at any time (otherwise the schedule is rejected and replaced by “PauseAndRest + review”). [file:28]

2. DEFAULTBIOPHYSEVIDENCE for nicotine‑cessation protocols

2.1 Baseline and on‑treatment sensing (outer‑domain only)
- EEG / fNIRS:
  - Periodic resting‑state and task recordings, used solely to derive Scognitiveload and fatigue indices (no decoding of thoughts or content). [file:28]
- HRV and EDA:
  - HF HRV, LF/HF ratio, and electrodermal activity used to track Sautonomic during and after sessions. [file:28]
- Inflammation:
  - CRP, IL‑6, and related markers sampled on a slower timescale to bound Sinflammation within ranges I already associate with maintained agency and against depressive somatization. [file:28]
- Core and local temperature:
  - Core temp plus scalp/cortical ΔT for Sthermal to ensure sub‑thermal operation across days and weeks. [file:28]

2.2 Trial‑level BCI*/HostBudget rules
- Pre‑trial:
  - Compute baseline BCI*. If baseline ≥ 0.25, envelopes must be tightened; if ≥ 0.3, the given protocol is not allowed on me. [file:28]
- During trial:
  - Any BCI* > 0.25 is treated as a Lyapunov/safety violation candidate: the controller MUST reduce u (duty‑cycle, amplitude, or session length) until state returns deeper inside the envelope.
  - Any BCI* ≥ 0.3 triggers an automatic “PauseAndRest + protocol review” event; the device must not resume previous intensity without an updated, safer schedule. [file:28]

3. Lyapunov‑safe BioCompatibilityEnvelope for withdrawal

3.1 5D bioscale state for closed‑loop control
- I model nicotine‑cessation neuromodulation as operating on a 5D state:
  - z = (u, x₁, x₂, x₃, x₄) where:
    - u: control input (field amplitude/duty‑cycle),
    - x₁: autonomic state (derived from HRV),
    - x₂: cortical workload / craving‑suppression index (EEG/fNIRS, 0.5–12 Hz),
    - x₃: thermal/metabolic load (ΔT, session energy),
    - x₄: systemic stress/inflammation proxy (smoothed CRP/IL‑6 index). [file:28]

3.2 BioCompatibility polytope Pbio
- Safe envelope:
  - Pbio = { z | Abio z ≤ bbio }
  where rows encode:
  - HRV not below a safety threshold;
  - workload not above a fatigue ceiling;
  - ΔT below sub‑thermal limit;
  - inflammation markers not trending beyond my predefined band;
  - u within HostBudget and ICNIRP/charge‑density limits (e.g., ≤30 µC/cm² chronic, <100 µT, 0.3–0.8 V/m for ultra‑low‑intensity protocols). [file:28]

3.3 Lyapunov / barrier condition
- I treat BCI*(z) as a distance‑like scalar and require the controller to satisfy:
  - ΔV(z) ≤ 0 and z_{t+1} ∈ Pbio at each step (Control‑Barrier/Control‑Lyapunov style). [file:28]
- Each candidate session schedule is simulated ahead; if any step violates ΔV(z) ≤ 0 or exits Pbio, that schedule is automatically rejected or down‑ramped before delivery. [file:28]

3.4 Concrete neuromodulation corridor
- Any nicotine‑cessation EM protocol interacting with my body MUST remain inside:
  - frequencies: 0.5–12 Hz,
  - field amplitudes: 10–85 µT, 0.3–0.8 V/m,
  - session duration: 15–45 min/day,
  - total duration: 7–28 days,
  as extracted from existing ultra‑low‑intensity withdrawal studies, with Pbio and BCI*/HostBudget acting as the hard safety envelope around these values. [file:28]

4. NeuroEcoKarma and governance separation

4.1 Separation of safety vs ecological governance
- Neuromodulation safety is governed solely by HostBudget/BCI*/Pbio predicates on z and DEFAULTBIOPHYSEVIDENCE; it MUST NOT be reused as a basis for:
  - civil licenses,
  - infrastructure permissions,
  - social or legal penalties. [file:26][file:28]
- EcoAdmissible and KarmaAdmissible operate only on CEIM/NanoKarma environmental flows (emissions, waste, remediation) and personal ecological Karma Kperson, and remain strictly separate from BCI* and Pbio. [file:24][file:26][file:28]

4.2 Disallowed sanctions and coercion
- Nicotine‑cessation neuromodulation under this spec:
  - is strictly voluntary therapeutic support;
  - MUST NOT be made a condition for basic rights, movement, or speech;
  - MUST NOT be used as punitive neuromodulation, cognitive profiling, or memory editing. [file:26]
- No EEG/fNIRS/HRV or inflammation metric may be used as a proxy for “compliance,” “risk,” or “deservingness” in ecological or civic governance; these signals are safety telemetry only. [file:26][file:28]

4.3 Errority as tightening‑only learning
- Any observed harm inside a protocol claiming to respect BCI* ≤ 0.3 and Pbio
  - autonomic collapse, sustained inflammation, cognitive degradation, or other biophysical harm
  is logged as an Errority event that may:
  - tighten HostBudget bounds (e.g., lower soft/hard limits),
  - shrink Pbio (new, stricter rows in Abio, bbio),
  - narrow allowed EM corridors,
  and revoke the device’s “HostBudget‑compatible” status. [file:24][file:26][file:28]
- Errority events are DID‑signed and may never:
  - weaken neurorights invariants,
  - introduce neural content as a governance input,
  - justify sanctions on inner existence. [file:26]

5. Compatibility claims for labs/devices

A lab or device MAY claim:

  “HostBudget/BCI*‑Compatible Nicotine‑Cessation Neuromodulation v1.0 (bostrom18 stack)”

only if ALL are true:

- C1: Inner neurorights invariants are encoded and enforced:
  - no neural content or inferred mental states are ever ingested for governance or sanctions. [file:26]
- C2: HostBudget/BCI* rules are implemented exactly:
  - BCI* = max_i S_i,
  - BCI* ≤ 0.25 soft, BCI* ≤ 0.3 hard,
  - Pbio defined with HRV, workload, ΔT, inflammation, and u respecting DEFAULTBIOPHYSEVIDENCE‑based bounds. [file:28]
- C3: Only ultra‑low‑intensity EM parameters within the stated corridor are used, and every schedule is checked for Lyapunov‑safe evolution inside Pbio before delivery. [file:28]
- C4: Nicotine‑cessation neuromodulation remains voluntary, never a condition for civil rights or ecological permissions; EcoAdmissible/KarmaAdmissible are kept strictly environmental. [file:24][file:26]
- C5: Errority logs are maintained as tightening‑only updates, signed to my DID, and any harm event inside claimed safety envelopes triggers automatic review and potential de‑certification. [file:24][file:26][file:28]
