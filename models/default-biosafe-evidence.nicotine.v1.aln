  Evidence bundle for HostBudget and BioCompatibilityEnvelope during nicotine
  addiction neuromodulation—mapping raw physiology to normalized safety axes.

axes:
  - name: "Energy_E"
    modality: "metabolic load, sleep, HRV"
    evidence_refs:
      - "validating-bci-0-3-neurobiophy.md#HRV-fatigue"   # HRV, fatigue[file:23]
    units:
      - "ms_SDNN"
      - "sleep_efficiency_percent"
      - "METs"
    normalization:
      rule: |
        Map SDNN >= 70 ms and sleep_efficiency >= 90% to Energy_E ≈ 0.0.
        Map SDNN <= 30 ms and sleep_efficiency <= 70% sustained over ≥ 7 days
        to Energy_E ≈ 1.0, interpolate linearly otherwise.
    stress_label: "energy fatigue, allostatic load"

  - name: "Protein_Burden_M_prot"
    modality: "systemic inflammation"
    evidence_refs:
      - "validating-bci-0-3-neurobiophy.md#IL6-CRP"       # IL‑6, CRP[file:23]
      - "how-can-we-mathematically-figu.md#CEIM"          # CEIM integration[file:28]
    units:
      - "pg/mL_IL-6"
      - "mg/L_CRP"
    normalization:
      rule: |
        IL-6 <= 1 pg/mL and CRP <= 1 mg/L → M_prot ≈ 0.0.
        IL-6 >= 5 pg/mL or CRP >= 3 mg/L → M_prot ≈ 1.0.
        Use continuous ramp between these points, with Errority tags where cohort-specific.
    stress_label: "inflammation, tissue hazard"

  - name: "Bio_Impact_S_bio"
    modality: "drug load, nanoswarm, organ stress"
    evidence_refs:
      - "validating-bci-0-3-neurobiophy.md#nanoswarm"     # nanotoxicology[file:23]
      - "how-can-we-mathematically-figu.md#CEIM"          # mass-balance[file:28]
    units:
      - "mg/kg_drug"
      - "particles/mL_nanoswarm"
      - "normalized_liver_kidney_markers"
    normalization:
      rule: |
        Map zero or low chronic exposure to S_bio ≈ 0.0.
        Map LOAEL-equivalent nanoswarm dose or drug burden and persistent organ stress
        to S_bio ≈ 1.0, with intermediate scaling per toxicology curves.

  - name: "Duty_Residence_Time_theta"
    modality: "neuromodulation duty cycle"
    evidence_refs:
      - "validating-bci-0-3-neurobiophy.md#BioLimits"     # duty limits[file:23]
    units:
      - "fraction_time_active"
      - "minutes_per_session"
      - "sessions_per_week"
    normalization:
      rule: |
        Duty <= 0.1, sessions <= 2/week, session_length <= 20 min → θ ≈ 0.0.
        Duty >= 0.5, sessions >= 7/week, session_length >= 60 min → θ ≈ 1.0.

  - name: "Cortical_Temperature_deltaT"
    modality: "brain temperature"
    evidence_refs:
      - "validating-bci-0-3-neurobiophy.md#temperature"   # thermal safety[file:23]
    units:
      - "C_above_baseline"
    normalization:
      rule: |
        ΔT <= 0.5 C → ΔT_norm ≈ 0.0.
        ΔT >= 2.0 C sustained → ΔT_norm ≈ 1.0.

host_budget:
  scalar_name: "H_host"
  formula: "H_host = max( Energy_E, M_prot, S_bio, theta, deltaT )"
  ceiling: 0.3
  invariants:
    - "For any neuromodulation step: H_host_after <= H_host_before."
    - "Any update to axis bounds must tighten (no relaxation) unless labeled provisional_Errority with evidence."

errority:
  on_violation:
    - "Log Errority event with full telemetry and protocol ID."
    - "Tighten relevant axis envelopes; never relax."
