ZoneRepo is a cutting-edge simulation-class for Rust that replicates, and accurately-predicts behavior-patterns, movement, and frequency-of traveling, and other casual, and notable-types of human-behavior to see, and measure how-quickly a "situation" can become out-of-control, or lead-to possibilities of any-kind if a social-impact value is too-high for any-type of right, belief, habit, or tradition of humans when a new-discovery, a new-culture, or a new-concept directly-affects, or impacts an area, stating-with a small-population ( neighborhoods, home, etc. ) and working it's way-up to a city, or continent-scale, and so-on. The idea is to understand policies, how much of an impact an entertainment-function, a practiced-belief, or new-concept is-introduced into human-society, so-that lawmakers, regulators, and researchers may-see the ethical-values associated-with any new-introduction, and how it-affects the patterns, and movements between, and through the influence-of socially-accepted patterns, and behaviors. Calculations just-got more-real, and simulations are even-better; this is the real-deal, so human-society can weigh-in the differences for policies, and how technology can-be advanced with carefully-guided reasoning to understand how society will-behave, or react.
